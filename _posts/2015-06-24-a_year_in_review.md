To kick off this new site, I feel that I should check back on these past several months. It's crazy seeing how things change in such a short period.

Let's go back a year.

College admissions came out recently, and I received rejection after rejection while watching all my friends get accepted to Ivy League schools&mdash;it was a pretty terrible time. I think I reached a low point when I accepted an invitation to a college that I previously said that I didn't want to go to: Polytechnic Institute of New York University. I didn't have a choice; I was accepted into UIUC and a couple colleges in California but various reasons required me to live closer to home.

I wanted to get out of the city and spend some time away from it in a college campus. Here, there isn't even a campus. I was expected to spend four years of my life in just three buildings: Clark Hall, my dorm; Bern Dibner Library, which also houses a lecture hall; and 6 Metrotech, where I took most of my classes.

The start of college revealed that NYUPoly wasn't all that bad, though there were things that seriously [needed change](http://tumblr.sergeydgr8.com/post/83578963114/my-thoughts-on-poly). I wasn't learning. I had a lecture dedicated entirely to how to use Microsoft Word and a mathematics professor that would assign homework and exams and *then* teach us how to do them. There were weekly disputes with a professor in recitation whenever he pointed out that my team missed something in our presentations, when in reality we actually had it.

I know, it's not fair to judge an entire school's classes by a bunch of courses in freshman year. But what if my future classes are like the ones I had? What if my four years of college are going to be like this? I can't even imagine that.

I needed a way out.

That's where [hackathons](http://www.brianch.uk/devchukV1/blog/2014/09/28/hacklife/) came in. I went to my first one in February 2014, and I got hooked. They were an escape from the monotony of classes, a way for me to learn. To build. To have adventures with all these talented and cool people.

From that point to this day, I've showed up to

If I was able to give advice to myself one year ago, I wouldn't have anything to say. I'm happy with where I am and the direction I think I'm moving towards.

So what's next? The plan is to build even cooler stuff and have more adventures with awesome people while trying to write about it on this site. There's a huge list of ideas I'd like to try out, and now's the best time to get started.
