						Hey. I'm a software developer & elecrical engineer. This will be my sophomore year at <span id="detail1">New York University</span>. 
						<br><br>
						Currently, I am a devangelist for <span id="detail2">Syncano</span> and a <span id="detail3">hackNY Fellow</span> for <span id="detail4">Betterpath</span>. I've also built robots for work & research and have done some freelance jobs. Outside of work, you can find me building projects I find meaningful.
						<br><br>
						This website is my playground.<br>It's a sandbox for the work I create, and a home for my writing. It's a journal for my past, and a forecast for my future.

						I'm currently a Computer Science Major in the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. A couple courses that I have taken are Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms.<br><br>
						As of now, most of what I've learned in programming has come from self-teaching. I'm a strong believer in learning by doing and taking education into your own hands.

						The hackNY Fellows program pairs quantitative and computational students with startups which can demonstrate a strong mentoring environment: a problem for a student to work on, a person to mentor them, and a place for them to work.<br><br>
						Students enjoy free housing together over the course of 10 weeks and a pedagogical lecture series to introduce them to the ins and outs of joining and founding a startup.
