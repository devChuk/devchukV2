# devchuk.github.io 2.0

I'm remaking my personal website. The ideas for it are rather ambitious so this may take longer than any project I've ever done.

#Current Feature in Progress

**HACK_THE_CITY**: Background animation art in home page: water animation

#Notes

**HACK_THE_CITY**

Style: Low Poly Animated Art

Inspirations: [Finding Home](http://christmasexperiments.com/experiments/7) | [Enormo.us](http://enormo.us/)

Fly above animated water with nothing in the horizon

Generate land, calculate distance

Buildings shoots up

#TODO

The list is too long...
