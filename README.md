# devchuk.github.io 2.0

I'm remaking my personal website. The ideas for it are rather ambitious so this may take longer than any project I've ever done.

#Current Feature in Progress

**HACK_THE_CITY**: Front page

#Notes

**HACK_THE_CITY**

Style: Low Poly Animated Art

Inspirations: [Finding Home](http://christmasexperiments.com/experiments/xps/7/) | [Enormo.us](http://enormo.us/) | [Acko](acko.net)

Fly above animated water with nothing in the horizon

A path rises out of the water, follow path

Generate buildings

Path starts twisting and turning
